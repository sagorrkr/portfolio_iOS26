## Overview
This portfolio website showcases my projects and skills through an interactive and modern design, featuring dynamic color transitions, multilingual support, and a responsive layout.

## Technical Features

### Dynamic Background Animation
The website implements a dynamic background animation using JavaScript and CSS:
- Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth color transitions
- Colors shift every 3 seconds through a predefined palette
- Background gradient rotates 360 degrees continuously
- Custom easing functions for smooth transitions

### Theme Switching (Dark/Light Mode)
- Implements system preference detection using `prefers-color-scheme`
- Manual toggle switch in the navigation bar
- Smooth transition between themes using CSS variables
- Persistent theme storage using localStorage

### Multilingual Support
- Supports multiple languages (English French)
- Manual language selection through dropdown menu
- Smooth content transition during language switch
- Translation stored in JSON format

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts

  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- Dynamic font sizing using rem units
- Responsive images with lazy loading

### Interactive Elements
